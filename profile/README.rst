Hi! This is the official Github organization for hosting mirrors from the
`Cahute project on Gitlab.com`_, for bridging the gap with CASIO calculators!

These mirrors allow us to:

* Make the project visible to Github users;
* Have Cahute and related projects included in the `Github Archive Program`_.

*Happy Cahuting!*
